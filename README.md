# Face Alignment System using CNN

### Overview
This project implements a face alignment system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict facial landmarks. The system also includes functionality for modifying the color of lips and eyes based on the detected landmarks.

### Features
#### Facial Landmark Detection: Predicts 44 facial landmarks using a CNN model.
#### Data Augmentation: Applies rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping to enhance the robustness of the model.
#### Color Modification: Modifies the color of lips and eyes using the predicted landmarks.
